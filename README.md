# INFO 6150 Web Design and User Experience Engineering

## Course Description

This course exposes students to both conceptual and technical aspects of Web design. User experience design is the discipline of creating a useful and usable website or application that is easily navigated and meets the needs of both the site owner and its users. The course covers Web standards and best practices. It studies the fundamental concepts, techniques, practices, workflows, and tools associated with the practice of user-experience design in Web interfaces. Additional areas of focus include typography, color theory and composition, responsive design, CSS3 concepts, basic scripting, and JavaScript libraries to create functional, effective, and visually appealing websites.

## Standard Learning Outcomes

Learning outcomes common to all College of Engineering Graduate programs:

1. An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems.
2. An ability to explain and apply engineering design principles, as appropriate to the programâ€™s educational objectives.
3. An ability to produce solutions that meet specified end-user needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.

The Information Systems Program accepts students of different engineering backgrounds with minimum programming skills and produces first class Information Systems engineers that operate at the intersection of real-world complexity, software development, and IT management. Graduating students will be able to construct end-to-end advanced software applications that meet business needs.

## Specific Learning Outcomes for the Information Systems program:

1. Create a strong technical foundation through diverse, high-level courses
2. Built crucial interpersonal skills needed to succeed in any industry
3. Foster a deep level of applied learning through project-based case studies

## Course Outcomes and Assessment Standards

This course introduces front-end web design and principles concepts while working on web design projects. The course allows students to quickly understand and develop web pages that cater to customer and business needs. While doing the labs and final project, students can use and learn JavaScript skills, including libraries like Bootstrap, JQuery, React, Node JS, Express JS, and AngularJS. Security techniques will be discussed that can help avoid code injections in websites. The course will also introduce user experience concepts and their relation to front-end web design.

## Course Objectives:

1. Understand the User Experience concepts and the importance of making usable websites or products
2. Introduce front-end web design concepts
3. Develop web pages quickly using HTML and JavaScript as per the business needs
4. Learn HTML and JavaScript concepts
5. Learn concepts of Bootstrap, JQuery, Angular JS, React JS, NodeJS, Express JS JavaScript library
6. Work in the Lab to do hands-on practice of the concepts
7. Learn best practices and design patterns for the front-end development
8. Apply the knowledge readily to the next assignment or job

This class assumes no prior experience in the Front-end web design and development concepts. Basic web programming experience is helpful but is not required. Comfort with computers, desktop tools and general computing concepts are expected.
