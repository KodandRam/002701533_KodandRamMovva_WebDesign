Starbucks Corporation is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses and 
roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle, Washington.
It is the world's largest coffeehouse chain.
As of November 2021, the company had 33,833 stores in 80 countries, 
15,444 of which were located in the United States.
Out of Starbucks' U.S.-based stores, over 8,900 are company-operated,
while the remainder are licensed.
The rise of the second wave of coffee culture is generally attributed to Starbucks, 
which introduced a wider variety of coffee experiences. 
Starbucks serves hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, micro-ground instant coffee, 
espresso, caffe latte, full and loose-leaf teas, juices, Frappuccino beverages, 
pastries, and snacks. Some offerings are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. 
Depending on the country, most locations provide free Wi-Fi Internet access.
