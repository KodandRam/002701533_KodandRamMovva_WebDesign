                <h1>Hybrid Classification System for Sleep Apnea</h1>
                    <p>I devised a model that helps doctors assess sleep problems such as sleep apnea, irregular limb movements, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, and night-time behaviours. Such conditions will also not be detected during a regular visit to the clinic. This sleeping disorder may lead to heart failure, diabetes, increased blood pressure and may even cause death. We have developed a system to classify normal patient and a sleep apnea patient by utilising EEG and ECG signals of 18 patients. </p>

                    <h1>Time-Series analysis for sales forecasting using hybrid SARIMA</h1>
                        <p>We identified the demand pattern of stocks with the selling rate over time, keep track of inventory volume for efficient ordering, and suggest efficient orders in case of goods scarcity, as well as reduce the retailer's work by providing proper predictions. This particular project sparked my curiosity in learning more about Machine Learning.</p>

                      <p>I also developed a Cab hiring system with real time tracing of fare for the customer on board. This application also provides a loan system which allows customer to take a cab and pay for it later (limited distance) which is helpful in emergency situations.</p>
